# SnapAuth Swift SDK

This is the official Swift SDK for [SnapAuth](https://www.snapauth.app?utm_source=GitHub&utm_campaign=sdk&utm_content=sdk-swift).

SnapAuth will let you add passkey support to your native app in a snap!

🚧 This SDK is in beta! 🚧

## Platform Support

This SDK supports all major Apple platforms that support passkeys and hardware authenticators:

Platform | Passkeys | Hardware Keys | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
iOS | ✅ 15.0+ | ✅ 15.0+ |
iPadOS | ✅ 15.0+ | ✅ 15.0+ |
macOS | ✅ 12.0+ | ✅ 12.0+ |
macOS (Catalyst) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Still being tested (should work)
visionOS | ✅ 1.0+ | ❌ | Hardware keys are not supported on visionOS
tvOS | ⚠️ 16.0+ | ❌ | Still being tested, hardware keys are not supported on tvOS
watchOS | ❌ | ❌ | Apple Watch does not support passkeys

## Getting Started

### Register for SnapAuth

If you haven't already registered for SnapAuth, you'll need to do so: https://www.snapauth.app/register

Unlike for web integrations, `https` is still required even for `localhost` (web intergrations permit `http://localhost`).
Depending on your development setup, you may want to immediately add a testing or staging server environment.

> If you need help with this, we're happy to help - just send us an email!

### Set up associated domains

> [!WARNING]
> This is not SnapAuth-specific, but must be completed or the APIs will immediately return errors.

See the [Associated Domains setup guide](/DOMAINS.md) to configure your app to support passkeys.

### Add the SnapAuth SDK

XCode > File > Add Package Dependencies...

In the add package dialog, search for our SDK:

```
https://github.com/snapauthapp/sdk-swift
```

Select a Dependency Rule and add it to your development target.
We recommend "Dependency Rule: Up to Next Major Version".

We follow Semantic Versioning with all of our SDKs, so this should always be a safe option.

### Import the SDK

In any files that need to integrate with SnapAuth, be sure to import it:

```swift
import SnapAuth
```

### Call the API

Grab your `publishable key` from the SnapAuth Dashboard; you'll use it below.

This will typically be done in a Button's action.
Here's a very simple sign-in View in SwiftUI:

```swift
import SnapAuth
import SwiftUI

struct SignInView: View {
  let snapAuth = SnapAuth(publishableKey: "pubkey_yourkey") // Set this value!

  @State var userName: String = ""

  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      TextField("Username", text: $userName)
      Button("Sign In", systemImage: "person.badge.key") {
        signIn()
      }
    }
  }

  func signIn() {
    Task {
      let result = await snapAuth.startAuth(.handle(userName))
      switch result {
      case .success(let auth):
        // Send auth.token to your backend to sign in the user
      case .failure(let error):
        // Decide how to proceed
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Autofill-assisted Requests

To have the system suggest a passkey when a username field is focused, make the following additions to start the process and handle the result:

1. Add `.textContentType(.username)` to the username `TextField`, if not already set:

```swift
TextField("Username", text: $userName)
  .textContentType(.username) // <-- Add this
```

2. Run the autofill API when the view is presented:

```swift
// ...
var body: some View {
  VStack {
    // ...
  }
  .onAppear(perform: autofill) // <-- Add this
}

// And this
func autofill() {
  Task {
    let autofillResult = await snapAuth.handleAutofill()
    guard case .success(let auth) = autofillResult else {
      // Autofill failed, this is common and generally safe to ignore
      return
    }
    // Send auth.token to your backend to sign in the user, as above
  }
}
```


## Known issues

In our testing, the sign in dialog in tvOS doesn't open, at least in the simulator.

Even with the Apple-documented configuration, the AutoFill API does not reliably provide passkey suggestions.
